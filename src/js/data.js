    <h1>about me</h1>
    <p>lover of - unicorns Â· purples Â· donuts</p>
    <p>I'm Olaolu Olawuyi, a creative currently based in Lagos, Nigeria. I live a simple life being optimistic about things and smiling most of the time. I also like to explore my "funtography" skills when I'm not in front of my computer.</p>
    <p>I've spent over 7 years building applications and products ranging from basic to very complex ones. I focus on creating blazing fast and very elegant user experiences. I currently lead the front-end engineering team at Conectar LLC where we're building one of the biggest React applications in the world and I'm a Technical Talent Partner at <a href="http://teenscancode.com.ng" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Teens Can Code Africa</a>, a non-profit organization helping to expand teens' access to technology through problem-solving and coding in Africa. In the past few years, I've worked with several organizations to deliver services and solutions. I'm also the creator of the famous <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=whizkydee.material-palenight-theme" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Palenight theme</a> for VS Code with hundreds of thousands of installs.</p>
    <p>I'm passionate about <b>JavaScript</b> applications including frameworks like React, Node.js and a bunch. I'm currently open to ideas and very flexible remote or contract work.</p>
    <p>Love my work? A box of unicorn donuts would be nice ðŸ˜Š. Please <a href="https://bit.ly/payOlaolu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">donate</a>.</p>
