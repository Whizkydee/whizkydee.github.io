    <h1>about me</h1>
    <div>lover of - unicorns Â· purples Â· donuts</div>
    <p>I'm Olaolu Olawuyi, a 17 year old, and a student of the University of Lagos, Nigeria. I live a simple life, I love being optimistic about things and I smile a lot. I explore my funtography skils when I'm not busy or in front of my laptop. I'm an impostor, and yeah, I'm a July born - July 01.</p>
    <p>As a web developer, I've had 7+ years of experience building websites and applications ranging from simple to very complex ones. I focus on creating blazing fast and very elegant user experiences. I head tech operations at <a href="http://teenscancode.com.ng" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Teens Can Code Africa</a>, a non-profit organization helping to expand teens' access to technology through problem-solving and coding in Africa. I've worked with organizations like Pneuma media, MrShopperHQ and a bunch in the past to deliver services and solutions. I'm also the creator of the famous <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=whizkydee.material-palenight-theme" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Palenight theme</a> for VS Code which currently has 100K+ installs.</p>
    <p>I love to build applications in core <b>JavaScript</b>. I use frameworks like React, Vue, Node.js and a bunch. I'm currently open to ideas and very flexible remote or contract work.</p>
    <p>Love my work? A box of unicorn donuts would be nice ðŸ˜Š. Please <a href="https://bit.ly/payOlaolu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">donate</a>.</p>
