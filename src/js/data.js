    <h1>about me</h1>
    <p>lover of - unicorns Â· purples Â· donuts</p>
    <p>I'm Olaolu Olawuyi, a creative currently based in Lagos, Nigeria. I live a simple life being optimistic about things and smiling most of the time. I also like to explore my (what I call) "funtography" skills when I'm not in front of my computer.</p>
    <p>Over the past 7 years, I've built applications and products ranging from basic to very complex ones with focus on creating blazing fast and elegant user experiences. I previously led the front-end engineering team at Conectar LLC where we're building one of the biggest React applications in the world and I'm a Technical Talent Partner at <a href="http://teenscancode.com.ng" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Teens Can Code Africa</a>, a non-profit org helping to expand teens' access to technology through problem-solving and coding in Africa. In the past few years, I've worked with several startups and organizations around the world to deliver solutions. I also created the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=whizkydee.material-palenight-theme" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Palenight theme</a> for VS Code with hundreds of thousands of downloads.</p>
    <p>I'm passionate about web performance and JavaScript applications. Open for consultation, ideas and very flexible remote or contract work.</p>
    <p>Love my work? A box of unicorn donuts would be nice ðŸ˜Š. Hey! You might want to <a href="https://bit.ly/payOlaolu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">donate</a>.</p>
